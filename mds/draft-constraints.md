# Constraints

## Introduction

Constraints are rules defined as part of the data model to control what values are allowed in specific columns and tables.

_Specifically, constraints:_

- Reject inserts or updates containing values that shouldn’t be inserted into a database table, which can help with preserving data integrity and quality.
- Raise an error when they’re violated, which can help with debugging applications that write to the DB.

_Constraints:_ Data types, `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `CHECK`, `FOREIGN KEY`.
